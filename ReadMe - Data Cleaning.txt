Here's a framework for an Automated Data Cleaning Pipeline in Python that handles missing values, formats data, and detects outliers. It focuses on data manipulation, error handling, and modular code design, using pandas for data operations and logging for recording cleaning actions and potential errors.
Key Aspects:
	1. Data Manipulation:
		handle_missing_values(): Handles missing values using different strategies.
		format_columns(): Formats column names for consistency.
		detect_outliers(): Identifies potential outliers using the Z-score method.
	2. Error Handling:
		Logging is used to record errors and actions during data loading, cleaning, and transformations.
	3. Modular Code Design:
		Reusable functions for each task allow flexibility and maintainability.

Testing:
The sample data generated in the code demonstrates handling of missing values, column formatting, and outlier detection. You can run the script to see logs and outputs based on the provided sample dataset.
